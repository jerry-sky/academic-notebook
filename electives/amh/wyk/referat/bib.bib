  abstract = "The theory of deterministic sequencing and scheduling has expanded rapidly during the past years. In this paper we survey the state of the art with respect to optimization and approximation algorithms and interpret these in terms of computational complexity theory. Special cases considered are single machine scheduling, identical, uniform and unrelated parallel machine scheduling, and open shop, flow shop and job shop scheduling. We indicate some problems for future research and include a selective bibliography."

  abstract = { We describe an approximation algorithm for the problem of finding the minimum makespan in a job shop. The algorithm is based on simulated annealing, a generalization of the well known iterative improvement approach to combinatorial optimization problems. The generalization involves the acceptance of cost-increasing transitions with a nonzero probability to avoid getting stuck in local minima. We prove that our algorithm asymptotically converges in probability to a globally minimal solution, despite the fact that the Markov chains generated by the algorithm are generally not irreducible. Computational experiments show that our algorithm can find shorter makespans than two recent approximation approaches that are more tailored to the job shop scheduling problem. This is, however, at the cost of large running times.}

  abstract = "A computationally effective heuristic method for solving the minimum makespan problem of job shop scheduling is presented. The proposed local search method is based on a tabu search technique and on the shifting bottleneck procedure used to generate the initial solution and to refine the next-current solutions. Computational experiments on a standard set of problem instances show that, in several cases, our approach, in a reasonable amount of computer time, yields better results than the other heuristic procedures discussed in the literature."

  abstract = {We describe an approximation method for solving the minimum makespan problem of job shop scheduling. It sequences the machines one by one, successively, taking each time the machine identified as a bottleneck among the machines not yet sequenced. Every time after a new machine is sequenced, all previously established sequences are locally reoptimized. Both the bottleneck identification and the local reoptimization procedures are based on repeatedly solving certain one-machine scheduling problems. Besides this straight version of the Shifting Bottleneck Procedure, we have also implemented a version that applies the procedure to the nodes of a partial search tree. Computational testing shows that our approach yields consistently better results than other procedures discussed in the literature. A high point of our computational testing occurred when the enumerative version of the Shifting Bottleneck Procedure found in a little over five minutes an optimal schedule to a notorious ten machines/ten jobs problem on which many algorithms have been run for hours without finding an optimal solution.},

  abstract = {A fast and easily implementable approximation algorithm for the problem of finding a minimum makespan in a job shop is presented. The algorithm is based on a taboo search technique with a specific neighborhood definition which employs a critical path and blocks of operations notions. Computational experiments (up to 2,000 operations) show that the algorithm not only finds shorter makespans than the best approximation approaches but also runs in shorter time. It solves the well-known 10 x 10 hard benchmark problem within 30 seconds on a personal computer.},

  abstract = "Let M1 and M3 be non-bottleneck machines and M2 a bottleneck machine processing only one job at a time. Suppose that n jobs have to be processed on M1, M2 and M1 (in that order) and job i has to spend a time a, on M1, d1 on M2 and q1 on M3: we want to minimize the makespan. This problem is important since its resolution provides a bound on the makespan of complicated systems such as job shops. It is NP-hard in the strong sense. However, efficient branch and bound methods exist and we describe one of them. Our bound for the tree-search is very close to the bound used by Florian et al., but the principle of branching is quite different. At every node, we construct by an O(n log n) algorithm a Schrage schedule; then we define a critical job c, a critical set J and consider two subsets of schedules; the schedules when c procedes every job of J and the schedules when c follows every job of J. We give the results of this method and prove that the difference between the optimum and the Schrage schedule is less than d1."
