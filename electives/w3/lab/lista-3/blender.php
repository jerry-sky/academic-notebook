        <p>I’m using Blender since primary school.
            One day I opened a computer magazine that had a CD with Blender attached to it.
            I installed the program and that’s how it began.
        </p>
        <p>Unfortunately, most of my early work was lost, because back then I did not archive virtually anything.
            Additionally, after the end of secondary school I did not really create anything in Blender.
        </p>
        <p>I really like using Blender and creating things, so I certainly need to get back to it.</p>
        <p>Here are a few of my pieces from the past:</p>
