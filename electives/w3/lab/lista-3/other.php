                I’m interested in language learning.
                Right now, I can speak only my native language and English.
                I’m also trying to learn German at the moment.
                But I also find interesting Italian, French, Japanese, Korean, and Chinese.

                As a standard-issue white person I like mountain hiking.

                I like to play a video game occasionally.
                Usually it’s either an older title (nostalgia) or one from my very small and carefully curated list of
                newer games.
